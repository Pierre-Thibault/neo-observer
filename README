Neo-Observer is a Python module implementing the observer pattern using a 
centralized registry. You send an event to the registry and it will dispatch
the call the registered observers of the event. You can register functions or
subclasses of a defined observable interface. Events have a name, a sender and 
optional info object. You can register an observable to receive an event based
on its name, sender or both. Require Python 2.5 and higher (excluding 
Python 3).
